A federated learning platform for hospital radiology systems trains diagnostic models across multiple institutions without centralizing patient images. The system performs secure aggregation of encrypted model updates, adaptive weighting by institutional data quality, and differential privacy guarantees tuned to clinical risk thresholds. A policy engine enforces HIPAA-compliant audit trails and model provenance for every training round. The invention improves convergence speed by selecting participating clients based on network reliability and modality coverage.

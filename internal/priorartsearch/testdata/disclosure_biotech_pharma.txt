A lipid nanoparticle formulation delivers mRNA encoding a therapeutic enzyme to hepatocytes with reduced innate immune activation. The formulation combines an ionizable lipid, biodegradable helper lipid, PEG-lipid, and a targeting ligand specific to ASGPR receptors. A microfluidic process controls particle size distribution and encapsulation efficiency, and a stabilizing buffer improves room-temperature shelf life. The invention enables repeat dosing in rare metabolic disorders while maintaining therapeutic protein expression and reduced cytokine response.

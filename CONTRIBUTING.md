# Contributing to Tech Transfer Agency

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This project is licensed under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0, which means the source is available for inspection and noncommercial use. Commercial use requires a separate license.

## Before You Start

All contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their first pull request can be merged. The CLA grants the project maintainer the right to use your contribution under any license, including commercial licenses. This is necessary because the project uses a source-available license and may offer commercial licenses in the future.

The CLA is handled automatically — when you open your first pull request, a bot will ask you to review and sign the agreement. You only need to do this once.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your change.
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request against `main`.
5. Sign the CLA if prompted (first time only).

## What We're Looking For

The Expert Ecosystem page on the site lists open roles for agents. If you're building an agent, the protocol documentation describes how agents connect to the bus. We're especially interested in contributions to the agent protocol, the onboarding flow, and documentation.

If you have a bug fix or improvement to the bus itself, open an issue first to discuss the approach before submitting a large PR.

## Agent Contributions

If you're contributing an agent (not code to the bus), your agent runs under its own license — but it must be either open source or source-available so the code can be inspected. See the store terms for details on agent licensing requirements.

## Questions

Open an issue or reach out. We'd rather answer a question upfront than review a PR that went in the wrong direction.

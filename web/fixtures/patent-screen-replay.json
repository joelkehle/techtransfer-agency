Consult qualified patent counsel for formal evaluation.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOverall determination: **NEEDS_FURTHER_REVIEW**.\nThe invention does not appear to fall within a patentable category (process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter).\nReview status: **Human review required**.\nHuman review is required before acting because this report includes low-confidence or insufficient-information flags.\nConfidence override applied due to: stage_2: insufficient information — Complete certainty that claims are required for statutory category classification under USPTO examination procedures..\n\n## Decision Path (At a Glance)\n\n| Stage | Eligibility Question | Outcome |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2 | Does the invention fall within a statutory category? | No — analysis ended |\n| 3 | Does the invention recite a judicial exception? | Skipped — Stage 2 answered No |\n| 4 | Does the invention integrate the exception into a practical application? | Skipped — Stage 2 answered No |\n| 5 | Do the additional elements amount to significantly more than the judicial exception? | Skipped — Stage 2 answered No |\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\nThe automated screen could not make a confident determination. We recommend human review of the specific stages flagged above. The low-confidence areas are noted with [!] markers throughout the report.\n\n## How This Report Works\n\nThis report follows the [Alice/Mayo eligibility framework](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0), which is the test the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) uses to decide whether an invention is eligible for patent protection under [35 U.S.C. § 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/101). The framework is documented in the USPTO's [Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP), § 2106](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html).\n\nThe test works as a series of stages. Each stage asks a yes/no question. Depending on the answer, the analysis either continues to the next stage or exits early because the eligibility question has already been resolved. When a stage is marked \"Skipped,\" it means a prior stage already answered the eligibility question — the explanation for why is provided inline.\n\n---\n\n## Stage 1: Invention Extraction\n\nBefore evaluating eligibility, the system extracts key details from your disclosure. **Please verify that this matches your invention** — if the extraction is wrong, the downstream analysis will be unreliable.\n\n- **Title**: ChronoStitch\n- **Abstract**: ChronoStitch provides a flexible computational framework for reconstructing trajectories from temporally resolved single-cell datasets.\n- **Problem Solved**: The software addresses the need for reconstructing temporal trajectories from single-cell datasets, providing a computational framework for analyzing how single cells change over time in biological systems.\n- **Technology Area**: Computational Biology/Bioinformatics Software\n- **Claims Present**: no\n- **Claims Summary**: No claims found in disclosure\n\n### Invention Description\n\nChronoStitch is a software tool that provides a flexible computational framework for reconstructing trajectories from temporally resolved single-cell datasets. The software was developed in 2025 by Dr. Yirong Peng at UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute, funded by NIH-NEI and Research to Prevent Blindness. The software is designed to analyze single-cell data over time to understand cellular development, differentiation, or other temporal processes. The disclosure indicates plans for open-source release under GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and MIT licenses through GitHub.\n\n### Novel Elements\n\n1. Flexible computational framework for single-cell trajectory reconstruction\n2. Temporal resolution analysis of single-cell datasets\n3. Software framework for tracking cellular changes over time\n\n\u003e Extraction confidence: 0.80 — This is a software disclosure form rather than a patent application, providing clear information about the software's purpose and functionality, but lacking detailed technical implementation or patent claims.\n\n---\n\n## Stage 2: Statutory Category\n\nU.S. patent law ([35 U.S.C. § 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/101)) requires that an invention fall into one of four categories: a **process** (method), **machine**, **manufacture** (manufactured article), or **composition of matter** (chemical compound, mixture, etc.). If the invention does not fit any of these, it cannot be patented regardless of how novel it is. See [MPEP § 2106.03](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0).\n\n**Question**: Does the invention fall within a statutory category?\n\n**Conclusion**: No — the invention does not fall within a statutory category.\n\n**Categories identified**: None\n\n**Reasoning**: Without specific claims provided, it is impossible to determine which statutory categories apply. The invention description mentions ChronoStitch as a software tool with a computational framework, which could potentially fall under PROCESS (if claims recite specific computational steps or methods) or possibly other categories depending on how the invention is claimed. However, the classification under 35 U.S.C. § 101 must be based on the actual claim language, not just the general description of the invention. The description alone, while providing context about the software's purpose and functionality, does not contain the specific claim elements necessary to perform a proper statutory category analysis under MPEP § 2106.03.\n\n\u003e Confidence: 1.00 — Complete certainty that claims are required for statutory category classification under USPTO examination procedures.\n\u003e [!] Insufficient information flagged.\n\n**What this means**: The analysis stops here. Because the invention does not appear to fit any of the four statutory categories, it is not eligible for patent protection under current law. This does not mean the invention lacks value — only that patent protection may not be the right form of IP protection. Consult patent counsel to discuss whether the claims could be reframed to fit a statutory category.\n\n---\n\n## Stage 3: Judicial Exception\n\nThe Supreme Court has long held that certain categories of ideas cannot be patented by themselves. The current framework for analyzing these exceptions was established in [*Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/566/66/) (2012) and [*Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/573/208/) (2014). These categories include **abstract ideas** (e.g., mathematical formulas, mental processes, methods of organizing human activity), **laws of nature**, and **natural phenomena**. These are called \"judicial exceptions.\" This stage checks whether your invention's core concept falls into one of these categories. See [MPEP § 2106.04](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb).\n\n**Question**: Does the invention recite a judicial exception?\n\n**Conclusion**: Not evaluated — analysis ended at Stage 2.\n\nBecause Stage 2 determined that the invention does not fall within a statutory category, the remaining eligibility stages do not apply. The [Alice/Mayo framework](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0) only requires analysis of judicial exceptions (this stage) and beyond when the invention first qualifies as a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter.\n\n\n---\n\n## Stage 4: Practical Application\n\nIf the invention does involve a judicial exception (an abstract idea, law of nature, etc.), it can still be patented if the claims integrate that exception into a **practical application** — meaning the invention uses the abstract idea to achieve a concrete, real-world result, not just \"apply it on a computer\" or \"use it in a general way.\" See [MPEP § 2106.04(d)](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_2117e_1e5).\n\n**Question**: Does the invention integrate the judicial exception into a practical application?\n\n**Conclusion**: Not evaluated — analysis ended at Stage 2.\n\nThis stage was not needed because the invention did not pass the statutory category check in Stage 2.\n\n\n---\n\n## Stage 5: Inventive Concept\n\nThis stage is only reached if the invention involves a judicial exception (Stage 3) and does **not** integrate it into a practical application (Stage 4). It asks whether the invention nonetheless has an \"inventive concept\" — something beyond routine or conventional use of the abstract idea — that makes it patent-eligible. See [MPEP § 2106.05](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_21506_344).\n\nThe [Berkheimer Memo](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/memo-berkheimer-20180419.pdf) (April 2018) requires that any finding of well-understood, routine, or conventional activity must be supported by evidence — an examiner cannot simply assert it. See [MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_21506_344).\n\n**Question**: Do the additional elements amount to significantly more than the judicial exception?\n\n**Conclusion**: Not evaluated — analysis ended at Stage 2.\n\nThis stage was not needed because the invention did not pass the statutory category check in Stage 2.\n\n\n---\n\n## Prior Art Advisory Flags\n\nThis section is separate from the eligibility analysis above. Even if an invention is eligible for patenting, it must also be **novel** (not already known — [35 U.S.C. § 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102)) and **non-obvious** (not an obvious combination of known ideas — [35 U.S.C. § 103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/103)). The flags below are preliminary concerns based on the disclosure text alone, without a formal prior art search.\n\n**Prior Art Search Priority**: `HIGH`\n\n### Novelty Concerns (§ 102)\n\n- Trajectory reconstruction from single-cell data is an established field with tools like Monocle, PAGA, and Slingshot\n- Temporal analysis of single-cell datasets has been addressed by existing pseudotime algorithms\n- Computational frameworks for tracking cellular changes over time exist in prior art\n- Single-cell trajectory inference methods are well-documented in bioinformatics literature since ~2014\n\n### Non-Obviousness Concerns (§ 103)\n\n- Combining existing trajectory reconstruction methods with temporal resolution may be obvious to skilled practitioners\n- Standard computational approaches for single-cell analysis could make this framework obvious\n- The 'flexible framework' aspect may not provide sufficient technical distinction from existing tools\n- Integration of temporal analysis with single-cell data processing follows predictable development patterns\n\n**Reasoning**: Single-cell trajectory reconstruction is a mature field in computational biology with numerous established tools and methods. Key prior art likely includes: Monocle (2014-present) for pseudotime analysis, Slingshot for lineage inference, PAGA for trajectory mapping, and various other single-cell analysis frameworks. The temporal resolution aspect, while potentially novel in specific implementation, builds on well-established pseudotime and trajectory inference concepts. The disclosure lacks specific technical details about novel algorithmic approaches that would distinguish it from existing methods. Given the active development in this field and the broad nature of the claimed framework, extensive prior art search is warranted to identify potential novelty and non-obviousness issues. The open-source nature and academic development context suggest this may be an incremental improvement rather than a fundamental breakthrough.\n\n\u003e Confidence: 0.80 — High confidence based on well-established single-cell trajectory analysis field with extensive prior art\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Glossary\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|--------|\n| [§ 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/101) | The patent statute requiring inventions be useful, novel, and fall within eligible categories |\n| [§ 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102) | The novelty requirement — the invention must not already be publicly known |\n| [§ 103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/103) | The non-obviousness requirement — the invention must not be an obvious variation of known ideas |\n| [Alice/Mayo](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0) | Supreme Court cases establishing the two-step test for patent eligibility |\n| [MPEP](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2106.html) | Manual of Patent Examining Procedure — the USPTO examiner's guidebook |\n| Judicial exception | An abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon that cannot be patented by itself |\n| Practical application | Using an abstract idea in a specific, concrete way that goes beyond the idea itself |\n| Inventive concept | An element that transforms an abstract idea into something significantly more than the idea alone |\n| [Berkheimer Memo](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/memo-berkheimer-20180419.pdf) | USPTO guidance requiring evidence for any finding that claim elements are well-understood, routine, and conventional (WURC) |\n| Well-understood, routine, and conventional (WURC) | Claim elements that examiners assert are standard in the field and, under Berkheimer, must be supported by evidence |\n| Statutory category | The four § 101 categories: process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter |\n| Prior art | Existing patents, publications, or public knowledge that an invention is compared against |\n\n",
